Sort by Date Added and Album
============================

_Note: As of iTunes 12, it is not possible to sort by the "Show" tag. This
script has been changed to use the "Grouping" tag instead. This is unfortunate,
since the "Show" tag was almost never used for music, whereas the "Grouping"
tag is.  The other tag that could be used is the "Comments" tag, but the
"Grouping" tag was chosen because the I happened to have a lot of tracks with
the "Comments" tag set._

Normally when you sort your iTunes library by date added, tracks do not appear
in the order they appear on the album.

This script allows you to sort by date added, grouped by album, and in album
order.

To use:

1. Run the `install` script or manually copy `Sort by Date Added and
   Album.applescript` to `~/Library/iTunes/Scripts`.

2. Then, select some tracks in your library and select `Sort by Date Added and
   Album` from the scripts menu in iTunes.

3. Make the "Grouping" column visible and sort in descending order.

Voila! Your tracks are now sorted by date added, grouped by album and disc, and
in the order they appear on the album.
